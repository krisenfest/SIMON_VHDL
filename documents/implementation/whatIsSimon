	Simon, is a collection of ten block ciphers released to the public by the NSA in mid 
2013. Overall each cipher is almost identical, with different key and message bit lengths
diversifying each implementation. Simon is a balanced Feistel cipher, capable of 
encrypting blocks of data from 32bits up to 128bits in a single execution.
	The cipher was designed to fill a cryptographic gap in the market. Few encryption 
methods have been designed to work in the relatively new field of “lightweight 
cryptography”, an area concerning small, technically constrained devices. As the world 
moves towards a more connected and computerised one; increasingly devices are being built 
with networking capability. It is important therefore, that such devices should have some
level of protection when connecting to each other, or to larger control machines. A 
hacker should not be able to take control of the security in your house or the breaks of 
your car, for example.

	Simon, is a well tested encrypting algorithm with these constraints in mind. Designed
to be realised in hardware - though perfectly functional in software - the designers 
proclaim SIMON’s small hardware footprint, throughput and ability to be serialised at 
various levels. Decryption of Simon encrypted data is a process very similar to encryption;
in fact it is almost the very reverse of it, thus it is entirely possible to use much of 
the encryption components for decryption.
	Simon is also general use, giving developers the flexibility to integrate it into their
designs; thus giving developers an easier step towards encryption of their designs.
